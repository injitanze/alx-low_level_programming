Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. When one is  done with the project, he/she will be able to better understand the power and simplicity of Python dictionaries. So much is actually happening when we type d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}, but everything looks so simple for the user. Python doesnâ€™t use the exact same implementation than the one you will work on today though.
